# ProtoSchool Porto Chapter

Welcome! ðŸ˜ƒðŸ‘‹

The ProtoSchool Porto Chapter is a group *passionate* about all **"Decentralised Web"** things. :computer:

We aim to connect Porto area people interested in learning more about building for and on the decentralised web.

We focus on tools built by [Protocol Labs](https://protocol.ai), but are more than open to all decentralised compute, storage, and networking technologies.

Join us to learn, to evangelise, or just to get to know us. Everyone is welcome here!
