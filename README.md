# [ARCHIVED] ProtoSchool Porto Chapter


*******************************

### THIS REPO IS NO LONGER IN USE AND HAS BEEN ARCHIVED.

This repo has been archived as part of the transition to ProtoSchool's new local event leadership model, [announced](https://github.com/ProtoSchool/organizing/issues/84) in March of 2020. If this group is still hosting ProtoSchool workshops, they'll be listed on our events page.

**Please visit our [events page](https://proto.school/#/events) to find upcoming workshops near you** and learn more about the groups hosting them. 

**Learn more about [hosting events](https://proto.school/#/host)** under our new model, which makes it easier than ever for newcomers to start hosting ProtoSchool workshops based on our interactive [tutorials](https://proto.school/#/tutorials).

*********************************

Welcome! ðŸ˜ƒðŸ‘‹

The ProtoSchool Porto Chapter is a group *passionate* about all **"Decentralised Web"** things. :computer:

We aim to connect Porto area people interested in learning more about building for and on the decentralised web.

We focus on tools built by [Protocol Labs](https://protocol.ai), but are more than open to all decentralised compute, storage, and networking technologies.

Join us to learn, to evangelise, or just to get to know us. Everyone is welcome here!
